# Blockchain

I have built a basic blockchain in JavaScript with an API access and User Interface. It includes the following features:

* A proof of work algorithm to secure the network
* Hashing algorithms to secure the data within the blockchain
* The ability to mine new blocks containing data
* The ability to create transactions and store them in blocks
* An API/server that enables interaction with the blockchain from the internet
* A consensus algorithm to verify that network nodes have valid data and are synchronized
* A broadcasting system to keep the data in the blockchain network synchronized.
